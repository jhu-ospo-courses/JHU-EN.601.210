### In the beginning ... 
An open source software project starts when someone publishes source code using an OSI-approved license. 
But what makes a project a success? 
For the purposes of this course, we are going to consider a project with a healthy flow of inbound contributions to be a successful project. 
Using inbound contributions rather than outbound use is a very deliberate perspective. 
If we think about outbound uses and users, it can be difficult to count. 
* Did someone star a GitHub repo because they are a simple end user, or because they follow the developer, or because they are a developer using the source? 
* Did someone clone/fork a repo and use it, or abandon the project fork, or simply review and learn from it? 

If we look at an inbound contribution flow, regardless of what we count as a contribution, then we have some confidence that the contributor is an active user. 
Let's look at some simple role definitions:
* Maintainer: a primary author of a project with full privileges to write the project directory tree. 
* User: any person that is using a software project for its intended purpose.
* Developer: any person using a software project but futhermore also modifying the source to their own needs. 
* Contributor: any person offering a direct artifact back to the project, including source code patches, bug reports, configuration, documentation. 

A maintainer has a responsibility to the project. The creator or creators of a project are maintainers. 
They agreed on the initial license as their outbound social contract. 
They published the initial software, sharing it outbound using a liberal (OSI-approved) license in the hope that others would find it useful.
They set the direction and roadmap for the project. 
They share the responsibility for the outcomes. 

Users enjoy the fruits of the labour of the project maintainers and contributors. 
They still identify with the tribe around the project and act as advocates for the project. 

Developers are users that have taken the further step of downloading the project source to extend the project to some personal end. 
It could be to fix a bug. It could be to add substantial new functionality. 

Contributors give back to the project. In an earlier lesson, we saw how living on a fork of a project as a developer can be costly over time.
One isn't keeping up with the new functionality or bug fixes that may be flowing back to the project. 
Not having one's extensions and fixes accepted back into the main project tree means the cost of new integration is higher. 
It pays to contribute back any project extenstions. 
But it also pays to contribute back other artifacts. 
* Contributing a bug report still helps the project. The bug indicates a new test path or use. While the reporter may not know how to fix the bug, others might. 
* Contributing new configuration information broadens the user base which
