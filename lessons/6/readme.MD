# Scaling projects up even more (The role of non-profits in an open source enabled world) 

## Objectives
* Understand the growth problems of legal liability
* Understand how a non-profit company solves for liability
* Understand how a non-profit can enable and encourage the next wave of growth 
* Have some understanding of current challenges in the non-profit space

## Notes

To attract contributions and new maintainers, the project needs to be easy to deploy and use, 
easy to fork and build and experiment with, and finally create an easy path for such experiments to flow back as contributions. 
Making it easy for users to contribute more than just code will expand the project’s use. 
Eventually, getting the three on-ramps built, the project can hopefully grow to create a healthy ecosystem around the project.

But this stylized growth as drawn doesn't work. 

![Project growth capped by liability and IP risk](images/Capped.jpeg)

In a project’s growth curve, regardless of project ownership, two problems will arise to constrain growth.  
* Companies wanting to use the project in their solutions to customers often want clear IP practices, 
and neutral or clarified ownership or they will not participate.   
* Project maintainers cannot sustain the personal liability for the project for activities like events or costs around the infrastructure 
out of their own pocket.

Non-profit organizations solve these problems, allowing new corporate users to participate and the project message to grow. 
Bringing a project to an existing non-profit (or creating a new non-profit) benefits the project’s growth.  
* The non-profit adds stability to a project. The non-profit can: 
  - Provide direct services out of the budget (website, infrastructure, communications, etc.). 
  - Provide mentorship and experience (e.g. tooling, processes, governance (Code-of-Conduct), etc.). 
  - Guide, aid, and support capturing attention (events, meetups, collateral). 
  - Provides a legal backstop to protect the project. 
* The non-profit removes liability from the project maintainers (holding the bank account, signing the contract for meetups, etc.).  
* The non-profit is a center-of-gravity in the industry to attract relevant attention to the project from new participants, members, 
and the industry broadly (meaning it is an opportunity to attract users -> developers -> contributors to the project).  
* The non-profit as a holder of IP rights provides a more neutral space and known IP governance, 
encouraging further use of projects in product and service portfolios for project growth from other companies.  
* The non-profit provides a community focus on discussions and collaborative innovations across related projects. 
 
An interesting simple demonstration was an early non-profit in the late 1990s. 
The Apache httpd project had been growing well for a few years. 
Companies wanted to include the project as a component in their product offerings to customers 
(e.g. IBM wanted to use Apache httpd in Websphere, their line of products oriented to building websites). 
The IP controls in the Apache project were non-existent. 
The liability on the maintainers would be alarming if the software project was used in IBM products. 
IBM and others helped fund the Apache Software Foundation into existence, 
organizing the intellectual property management better, 
re-writing the Apache Software License 1.0 (a cribbed version of the BSD license) into the more commercially understood Apache 2.0 license, 
and removing liability from the maintainers as they were now legally protected by the non-profit corporation. 

The growth in the code base of pent-up modifications was startling. The code base tripled in the first quarter after the formation of the non-profit.

The idea of growth holds. 
An engineer in 2010 performed 
[an enormous datacrunch](https://www.openlife.cc/blogs/2010/november/how-grow-your-open-source-project-10x-and-revenues-5x) 
across the numbers and demonstrated that the nine largest, 
most vibrant project collections were all protected inside non-profit foundations. 
The tenth largest was inside a company. 

Companies that own and control an open source project, have a slightly different set of things to consider. 
While the maintainers are employees and have no personal liability risk, 
other companies are seldom interested in using and contributing to the project owned and controlled by one company. 
It puts their software supply chain of open source licensed components into products at risk. 
Again, put the open source licensed project into a non-profit creates a more neutral environment for collaboration. 

These non-profit organizations are corporations. They are typically structured in one of two ways:
* For the common good (i.e. a charitable organization providing services for the good of society). 
Many of the original non-profits (e.g., The Free Software Foundation, Perl Foundation, Python Foundation, Apache Software Foundation). 
* For technical corporate members (i.e. companies are members instead of individuals and can collaborate, protected from anti-trust rules). 
Most modern non-profits are organized this way (e.g., The Eclipse Foundation, The Linux Foundation, The OpenStack Foundation). 

Just as there were a set of activities that a project's maintainers worked on to grow a healthy community and ensure scaled software delivery, 
there are additional activities (performed in the context of the non-profit) that enable companies to more easily participate,
and to remove liability from the maintainers as individuals.

This essentially creates the fourth on-ramp for commercial participation to enable the next wave of growth.
