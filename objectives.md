# EN.601.210 Course Objectives

## Lesson 1: A brief history of software collaboration from 1950 to 2020
### Objectives
* Understand the breadth of history of software collaboration that culminated in the open source community
* Understand the key points along the timeline getting us to 2020
* Understand the open source definition formally and informally

## Lab 1: How to build 125 years worth of software value in an afternoon
### Objectives
* Establish that the software development environment works for all students taking the class.
* Download and build a large piece of software from scratch, then deploy it to prove it worked.
* Analyze the software at a very high level to understand the value that was just built and installed.
* Analyze the project at a high level to understand what sorts of on-ramps were provided for new users.

## Lesson 2: The Engineering Economics of Open Source Software (or why we do what we do)
### Objectives
* Understand the engineering economics of consuming OSI-licensed projects into one's own software projects.
* Understand the imperative of engineering contributing back when one consumes OSI-licensed projects.
* Understand something of the dynamic nature of software.

## Lesson 3: What healthy open source software projects look like (On-ramps and practices)
### Objectives
* Understand the general roles in a project community
* Understand the simple community dynamic in community
* Understand the on-ramps and activities successful project communities display

## Lab 2: Evaluating projects
### Objectives
* Download and build another open source licensed software project from a short list of projects.
* Evaluate the experience, and evaluate the experience against the list of activities.
* Use a couple of other Web resources to further explore the project.
* Report on the experience and report on the project versus the criteria list.

## Lesson 4: No scale without discipline (Software Engineering 101)
### Objectives
* Understand the difference between programming-in-the-small and large systems programming.
* Be able to explain the basic practices that are needed to deliver software at scale, and why they are needed.
* Understand how to apply these ideas back to open source software projects as learning experiences, and as criteria for judging project health.

## Lesson 5: What is this madness called licensing and why you might care (a little)
### Objectives
* Understand the (very) simple basics of intellectual property protection
* Be able to explain the basic license groups in the free and open source software space
* Know the basic licenses, and where to find more data
* Have some understanding of current controversies and the implications in an open source community

## Lesson 6: Scaling projects up even more (The role of non-profits in an open source enabled world) 
### Objectives
* Understand the growth problems of legal liability
* Understand how a non-profit company solves for liability
* Understand how a non-profit can enable and encourage the next wave of growth 
* Have some understanding of current challenges in the non-profit space
